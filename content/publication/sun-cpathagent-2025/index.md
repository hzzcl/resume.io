abstract: Recent advances in computational pathology have led to the emergence of
  numerous foundation models. These models typically rely on general-purpose encoders
  with multi-instance learning for whole slide image (WSI) classification or apply
  multimodal approaches to generate reports directly from images. However, these models
  cannot emulate the diagnostic approach of pathologists, who systematically examine
  slides at low magnification to obtain an overview before progressively zooming in
  on suspicious regions to formulate comprehensive diagnoses. Instead, existing models
  directly output final diagnoses without revealing the underlying reasoning process.
  To address this gap, we introduce CPathAgent, an innovative agent-based approach
  that mimics pathologists’ diagnostic workflow by autonomously navigating across
  WSI through zoom-in/out and move operations based on observed visual features, thereby
  generating substantially more transparent and interpretable diagnostic summaries.
  To achieve this, we develop a multi-stage training strategy that unifies patch-level,
  region-level, and WSI-level capabilities within a single model, which is essential
  for replicating how pathologists understand and reason across diverse image scales.
  Additionally, we construct PathMMU-HR², the first expert-validated benchmark for
  large region analysis. This represents a critical intermediate scale between patches
  and whole slides, reflecting a key clinical reality where pathologists typically
  examine several key large regions rather than entire slides at once. Extensive experiments
  demonstrate that CPathAgent consistently outperforms existing approaches across
  benchmarks at three different image scales, validating the effectiveness of our
  agent-based diagnostic approach and highlighting a promising direction for computational
  pathology.
