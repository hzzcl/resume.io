**Congratulations on the Successful Conclusion of the First West Lake Summit on Digital and Intelligent Pathology (DIPS 2025)!**

The ‌First West Lake Summit on Digital and Intelligent Pathology‌ has been successfully concluded. Held on ‌March 30, 2025‌, at ‌West Lake University’s Yungu Campus‌ (No. 600, Dunyu Road, West Lake District, Hangzhou), the summit brought together leading experts, including ‌academicians from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, directors of top-tier hospitals, engineering pioneers from universities, and pathology thought leaders‌.

Focused on ‌AI-driven digital pathology transformation‌, the summit facilitated in-depth discussions on ‌integrating large AI models into clinical pathology practice‌ to enhance diagnostic precision and efficiency. Participants explored strategies to maximize the potential of AI in pathology, paving the way for a ‌smarter, more accurate era in the field‌.

The event was ‌hosted by West Lake University, the Chinese Medical Association Pathology Branch, and the Beijing Precision Pathology Development Foundation‌, with ‌West Lake University as the organizer‌.

We extend our gratitude to all speakers, attendees, and partners for contributing to this milestone exchange. The insights shared will undoubtedly accelerate the ‌intelligent evolution of pathology‌.
