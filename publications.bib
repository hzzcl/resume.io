  abstract = {Histopathology Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis serves as the gold standard for clinical cancer diagnosis in the daily routines of doctors. To develop computer-aided diagnosis model for WSIs, previous methods typically employ Multi-Instance Learning to enable slide-level prediction given only slide-level labels. Among these models, vanilla attention mechanisms without pairwise interactions have traditionally been employed but are unable to model contextual information. More recently, self-attention models have been utilized to address this issue. To alleviate the computational complexity of long sequences in large WSIs, methods like HIPT use region-slicing, and TransMIL employs approximation of full self-attention. Both approaches suffer from suboptimal performance due to the loss of key information. Moreover, their use of absolute positional embedding struggles to effectively handle long contextual dependencies in shape-varying WSIs. In this paper, we first analyze how the low-rank nature of the long-sequence attention matrix constrains the representation ability of WSI modelling. Then, we demonstrate that the rank of attention matrix can be improved by focusing on local interactions via a local attention mask. Our analysis shows that the local mask aligns with the attention patterns in the lower layers of the Transformer. Furthermore, the local attention mask can be implemented during chunked attention calculation, reducing the quadratic computational complexity to linear with a small local bandwidth. Building on this, we propose a local-global hybrid Transformer for both computational acceleration and local-global information interactions modelling. Our method, Long-contextual MIL (LongMIL), is evaluated through extensive experiments on various WSI tasks to validate its superiority. Our code will be available at github.com/invoker-LL/Long-MIL.},

  abstract = {Point-based cell detection (PCD), which pursues high-performance cell sensing under low-cost data annotation, has garnered increased attention in computational pathology community. Unlike mainstream PCD methods that rely on intermediate density map representations, the Point-to-Point network (P2PNet) has recently emerged as an end-to-end solution for PCD, demonstrating impressive cell detection accuracy and efficiency. Nevertheless, P2PNet is limited to decoding from a single-level feature map due to the scale-agnostic property of point proposals, which is insufficient to leverage multi-scale information. Moreover, the spatial distribution of pre-set point proposals is biased from that of cells, leading to inaccurate cell localization. To lift these limitations, we present DPA-P2PNet in this work. The proposed method directly extracts multi-scale features for decoding according to the coordinates of point proposals on hierarchical feature maps. On this basis, we further devise deformable point proposals to mitigate the positional bias between proposals and potential cells to promote cell localization. Inspired by practical pathological diagnosis that usually combines high-level tissue structure and low-level cell morphology for accurate cell classification, we propose a multi-field-of-view (mFoV) variant of DPA-P2PNet to accommodate additional large FoV images with tissue information as model input. Finally, we execute the first self-supervised pre-training on immunohistochemistry histopathology image data and evaluate the suitability of four representative self-supervised methods on the PCD task. Experimental results on three benchmarks and a large-scale and real-world interval dataset demonstrate the superiority of our proposed models over the state-of-the-art counterparts. Codes and pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/windygoo/DPA-P2PNet.},
